# Shopping List
This is my solution to the ZTM Webdevloper Challenge for "DOM Events".

On "Zero to Mastery" we talked about manipulating the DOM model and eventListeners.
Exercise:
_Using the Shopping List files from the previous videos update the shopping list app to do the following:
If you click on the list item, it toggles the .done class on and off.
Add buttons next to each list item to delete the item when clicked on its corresponding delete button.
BONUS: When adding a new list item, it automatically adds the delete button next to it (hint: be sure to check if new items are clickable too!)_

This example additionally features:
- Turn whatever input comes into a proper entry (first letter uppercase, rest lower case)
- Hide the "Delete" button if the item is completed
